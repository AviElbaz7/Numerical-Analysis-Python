        Find as many intersection points as you can. The assignment will be

        with a positive x and one with a negative x.
        
        This function may not work correctly if there is infinite number of

        Parameters
        ----------
        f1 : callable
            the first given function
        f2 : callable
            the second given function
        a : float
            beginning of the interpolation range.
        b : float
            end of the interpolation range.
        maxerr : float
            An upper bound on the difference between the
            function values at the approximate intersection points.


        Returns
        -------
        X : iterable of approximate intersection Xs such that for each x in X:
            |f1(x)-f2(x)|<=maxerr.
